                    <p>Chris Gordon is a rookie with the NYPD - one with a secret. In his spare time Chris is an exorcist without equal with a gift from God. 
                        But when he saves a beautiful girl from a demonic attack, he discovers there is more to fear than just demons. 
                        Finding himself surrounded by vampires, were weasels, and facing a giant short-faced bear, Chris struggles to stay alive, all while protecting his deadly new girlfriend.
                        And then there's her over protective vampire mother!</p>

                    <p>As a professional wizard, Harry Dresden knows firsthand that the “everyday” world is actually full of strange and magical things—and most of them don’t play well with humans. 
                        And those that do enjoy playing with humans far too much. He also knows he’s the best at what he does. Technically, he’s the only at what he does. 
                        But even though Harry is the only game in town, business—to put it mildly—stinks.
                        So when the Chicago P.D. bring him in to consult on a double homicide committed with black magic, Harry's seeing dollar signs.
                        But where there's black magic, there's a black mage behind it. And now that mage knows Harry's name...</p>

                    <p>When a reluctant druid gets blackmailed into working for an evil faery queen, he'll walk through fire to complete one last job⁠—come hell or high magic!
                        Every druid knows...
                        Dealing with the Fae is a death sentence.
                        So why would I risk my life to help an evil Faery Queen?
                        A year ago I swore off druidry, and for good reason. Now I spend my days behind six acres of scrap iron, steel, and magic wards, where the fae can’t bother me.
                        But when a Faery Queen with god-like magical powers calls, you don’t send her to voicemail. Now I have no choice but to find out why evil incarnate has requested my presence.
                        One thing’s for sure...
                        If I get dragged back into the supernatural world, there's gonna be hell to pay for it!</p>
